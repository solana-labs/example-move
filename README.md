# Move on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
to build, deploy, and interact with Libra Move programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* A library to interact with the on-chain Move loader and virtual machine to create Genesis' accounts and mint and pay Libra coins: `src/program`
* Command-line front-end that exercises the LibraPay library: `src/cli/`

## Getting Started

First fetch the npm dependencies, including `@solana/web3.js`, by running:
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Select a Network

The example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

To enable on-chain Move loader/VM logs, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

`$ export RUST_LOG=${RUST_LOG:-solana=info,solana_move_loader_api=trace,solana_runtime=debug}`

To start a local Solana cluster run:
```bash
$ npm run localnet:update
$ npm run localnet:up
```

Solana cluster logs are available with:
```bash
$ npm run localnet:logs
```

For more details on working with a local cluster, see the [full instructions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js#local-network).

Alternatively to connect to the public testnet, `export LIVE=1` in your
environment.  By default `LIVE=1` will connect to the
beta testnet.  To use the edge testnet instead, define `export CHANNEL=edge' in
your environment (see [url.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/urj.js) for more)

### Run the Command-Line Front End

```sh
$ npm run start
```

## Customizing the Program
To customize, make changes to the files under `/src`

Now when you run `npm run start`, you should see the results of your changes.
